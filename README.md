# Flutter Fade Package

The **Flutter Fade Package** is a tool designed to empower freelancers by ensuring their rights are protected. It allows you to make specific widgets in your app fade out after a predefined period, encouraging timely payment from clients.

---

## Features

- Easily hide widgets based on a deadline.
- Customizable fade-out timing.
- Simple integration into your Flutter app.

---

## How It Works

1. **Set the Deadline**: Specify the date when you expect payment from the client.
2. **Wrap Your Widgets**: Use the provided widget wrapper to define elements that should fade out.
3. **Automated Action**: The package will handle the rest, making the app fade out when the deadline approaches. 

Example of the fading effect:

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Wrap Your MaterialApp with the `Fade` Widget

First, integrate the `Fade` widget at the root of your app. Configure it with the payment status, deadline, and any functions you wish to execute.

```dart
Fade(
  paid: false, // Set to true once payment is received
  dateTime: DateTime(2021, 4, 10), // The agreed payment deadline
  materialApp: MaterialApp(
    title: 'Fade',
    theme: ThemeData(
      primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    ),
    home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Fade Page'),
  ),
);
```

### Step 2: Wrap Widgets with `ContainerF`

Next, identify the widgets you want to hide as the deadline approaches. Wrap them with the `ContainerF` widget and specify the number of days before fading.

```dart
ContainerF(
  child: Container(
    height: 60, 
    width: 60, 
    color: Colors.red, // This widget will fade out when the deadline is near
  ),
  lastDaysToHideThis: 5, // Number of days before fading begins
);
```
